# Shark Store

Shark Store is an E-commerce website, it's functional and easy to use. The website is fully responsive and it's created using React JS. I used Redux and Redux toolkit to manange the state in the application, and Redux persist to store the shopping items. I used Styled components for styling elements. For log-in and sign-in, I used firestore to authenticate users and save them to the database. For the payement method, I used Stripe.
